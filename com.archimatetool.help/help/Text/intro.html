	<p><strong>Archi</strong><sup>&reg;</sup> is a free, open source, cross-platform tool to create ArchiMate models.</p>
    
	<p>The Archi<sup>&reg;</sup> modelling tool is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Architects and Modellers. It provides a low cost to entry solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate modelling language, or who are looking for a free, cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or institution and wish to engage with the language within a TOGAF<sup>&reg;</sup> or other Enterprise Architecture framework.</p>
    
	<p>Since its introduction, Archi has been widely adopted for real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used in-house  by major global companies and consultants. It is rapidly becoming the <em>de facto</em> open source ArchiMate modelling tool.</p>
    
	<p>The <a href="http://www.archimate.org/">ArchiMate</a><sup>&reg;</sup> modelling language is an open and independent Enterprise Architecture standard that supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/" target="_blank">The Open Group</a><sup>&reg;</sup> and is fully aligned with <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/" target="_new">TOGAF</a><sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
